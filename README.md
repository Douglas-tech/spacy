# Semantic Similarity

This repository contains a Python script for calculating semantic similarity using spaCy. It includes a Dockerfile for containerization.
It includes examples of similarity calculations between words, tokens in a sentence, and comparing a given sentence to a list of sentences.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository: https://hub.docker.com/r/douglastech/semantic


2. Run the Docker container: docker pull douglastech/semantic

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- spaCy library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:


2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

1. Run the script:

python semantic.py

This will perform various similarity calculations and display the results.

2. Explore the Code:

- The `semantic.py` file contains the main code logic.
- Edit the `gardenpathSentences` list in the file to add or modify the sentences for analysis.
- You can also customize the code to perform different semantic similarity tasks.
